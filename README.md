# Dentist Appointment Booking Voice Agent
This is a browser-based **voice receptionist** for a dental clinic.
It uses **FastAPI** (Python) + **OpenAI GPT** for natural conversation, browser **SpeechRecognition / SpeechSynthesis** for voice, and **Excel (openpyxl)** as the booking backend.

## Known Issue
In the demo, you may notice that the receptionist couldn’t change the doctor once a slot was already taken.  
This behavior can be improved by adjusting the **system prompt** and updating a two parts of the program logic so that changing the doctor clears only the doctor's name and asks the user to reselect. All other parts remain unchanged.

## Features
- Acts like a human receptionist:
  - Greets caller and guides the booking.
  - Collects **doctor, name, phone, service, date, and time**.
  - Understands **partial doctor names** (e.g. “Hasan”, “House”).
  - Politely handles overlaps and out-of-hours bookings.
- **Excel integration**: appointments are stored in `bookings_dentist.xlsx` (one sheet per doctor).
- **Voice-based UI**: works in Chrome desktop with microphone access.
  - When the patient speaks, the idle state in the right-hand corner changes to speaking mode.
  - The microphone glows when the Agent or patient speaks.
- Simple static frontend (`static/index.html`) to test the flow.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **AI / NLU**: OpenAI GPT (`gpt-4o-mini`)
- **Voice**: Browser Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition + SpeechSynthesis)
- **Data storage**: Excel via [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS served from FastAPI static files

## Setup

### 1. Create virtual environment & install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate # on Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate # on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(If you don’t have requirements.txt, you can install manually:)
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv openai openpyxl python-dateutil
```

### 2. Add environment variables
Create a file named `.env` in the project root:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
BRAND_NAME="Demo Dental Clinic"
TZ=UTC
```
⚠️ `.env` is in `.gitignore` → it will not be uploaded to GitHub.

### 3. Run the server
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```
Now open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/

## Notes
- Tested with Chrome desktop (mic required).
- Demo only — not for production use.
- Make sure to keep `.env` private (never commit API keys).
